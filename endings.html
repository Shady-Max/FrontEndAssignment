The chest is popped open and multiple flies leave it. The chest is then opened up further, showing Isaac's skeletal remains. A spider can be seen crawling inside the eye hole of Isaac's skull and a fly zooms into the camera, then the scene switches over to a dull-colored ghastly landscape. Isaac pops out of a red chest, and a large shadow forms behind him. The shadow then grows fangs and red eyes as the scene blacks out accompanied with Devil Room ambiance.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id="ending20">Ending 20 (Delirium Ending)</h2>
            <p>Isaac is shown lying inside his toy chest, breathing heavily. In memory, he is shown drawing and smiling (but still nude), but is distracted by noise (presumably his parents fighting), and looks at one of the drawings he made of his house with a caption saying "WE LIVED HERE". He remembers seeing his mother crying in front of the TV. His breathing gets faster as he remembers looking at a burnt version of The Polaroid, or the Torn Photo, with his father's face being partially burnt away, standing in front of his toy chest which is filled with polaroid photos. His breathing slows down, Isaac is shown turning blue in the chest, and a wall is shown. The pictures hanging on the wall are (from right to left): Isaac with his parents; Isaac's house; Isaac with Guppy; Isaac playing with his father; Isaac watching his parents fight; Isaac with his mother; Isaac with a wig / Magdalene; Isaac's mother with a knife, angry; a demon with the word "bad" written on it with red ink; a smiling demon with the words "I'm the devil" written on it (as well as a little arrow labeled "me" pointing at it); a pentagram, once again with the word "bad" written on it; and finally, a demon which is shown above Isaac's dead and blood-covered parents, laughing. The left side of the wall is also covered with the words "bad", "evil", and "I'm the devil". As the wall is shown, the noises of an argument in the background get louder, culminating in a man's voice audibly saying "I'm outta here!". After a cut to black, Isaac's skeleton is shown lying in the chest, covered in cobwebs. The chest is opened, and the Missing Poster from Ending 15 is shown falling off the telephone pole outside Isaac's house. Finally, Isaac is shown roaming the dull-colored ghastly landscape from Ending 17.</p>

            <h2 id="ending21">Ending 21 (Mother Ending)</h2>
            <p>Isaac is drawing a picture of Mother when Mom walks in. He attempts to hide the drawing from her, but is unsuccessful. Outraged, she asks Isaac if this is how he truly thinks of her. Despite Isaac's pleas, she throws him in a closet and leaves to cry. After a pause, she starts reciting the Lord's Prayer. Isaac begins to shake in the fetal position in the corner. The closet grows even darker, and a pair of red eyes fades in over him. He begins to hyperventilate as a statue of Satan appears behind him.</p>

        <section>
            <h2 id="finalEnding">Final Ending (Dogma & The Beast Ending)</h2>
            <p>After defeating The Beast, the sky cracks open as a beam of light smites the monster, sending it sinking into the lake of lava. Isaac then ascends into the beam, as recollections of past events play back; his Mom mourning her son's death, his Mom and Dad arguing, his Dad leaving without saying goodbye, his Dad stealing money from Mom's purse while she sleeps, and the restless nights Isaac endured overhearing his parents arguing, believing he was the cause. He then feels his fear and worries fall from his being, his ascent growing faster while ??? and The Lost fall from him. He sees his only companion, Guppy, his Mom and Dad loving each other, his Mother kissing him on the head as he falls asleep, and his own birth. Then, Isaac sees nothing.</p>
            <p>Isaac's Dad interjects, asking Isaac if he really wants the story to end like this and telling him that since he's the one writing it, it doesn't have to end this way. Isaac's Dad asks Isaac if he wants to make a new ending to the story — perhaps even a happy one. Isaac says okay, and his father begins the opening narration again, but with Isaac living with both of his parents instead of just his mother, as the screen fades to black and the credits appear.</p>
